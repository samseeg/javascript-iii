// Classes

/*
Classes are a tool for building similar objects over and over again.
They are a construct that helps your organize your code.

Let's work with some employees at a company.
You work for Widget Co.  They have hundreds of employees.
Make a class to help us build all of the employees.
Each employee has:
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- age

Each employee can:
- makeWidget
    - This returns a string equal to the employees first name + last name + the word widget
    IE - "Dave Smith Widget"

call your class Employee and receive all the data in the constructor in the order listed
*/
class Employee {
    constructor(first_name, last_name, email, age) {
        this.first_name = first_name;
        this.last_name = last_name;
        this.email = email;
        this.age = age;
    }
    makeWidget() {
        return this.first_name + " " + this.last_name + " Widget";
    }
        
}



/*

Next, make a manager for Widget Co.
The manager has all the same properties as an Employee.
They also have :

- reports (other employees) that defaults to an empty array
They can (methods) :
   - hire
        : Hire adds a new employee to their list of reports
   - fire(index)
        : Fire removes employees from their list of reports at the given index

call your class Manager

*/
class Manager {
    constructor(first_name, last_name, email, age) {
        this.first_name = first_name;
        this.last_name = last_name;
        this.email = email;
        this.age = age;
        this.reports = [];
    }
    hire(new_employee) {
        this.reports.push(new_employee);
    }
    fire(employee) {
        this.reports.splice(employee, 1);
    }
}




/*
Manager for Widget Co. get promoted when they get more employees, and get a bonus when they fire employees.
Progressive Managers have all the same properties as the manager, but
they also have :
- title - default 'Not a manager'
- bonus - default 0

When employees are added or removed we need to check and update their title.  Their titles are as follows:
0 : Not a manager
1-3 : Barely Manager
4-10 : Mostly Manager
11-50 : Manager
51-100 : Manager Plus
101+ : Bestest Manager

Everytime they fire an employee they get a bonus of $100 add to their .

call you class ProgressiveManager

/*
BLACK DIAMOND
Widget Co has a factory that makes widgets.
Factories have Machines

Make a Machine class that takes in no parameters
It has :
- widgets_made_count - default 0
- wear_and_tear_count - default 0
- needs_reboot - default false

It can :
- makeWidgets
    : This function takes in a number and increases widgets_made_count by that amount
      It also increases wear_and_tear_count by 1 for every 50
- fixMachine
    : This function sets needs_reboot to true
- reboot
    : This function returns a function that is called when the machine is done rebooting
      It should set decrease wear_and_tear_count by 10, and set needs_reboot to false
